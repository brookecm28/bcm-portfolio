Welcome to my portfolio! I built this website with React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, 
and a few design packages (Tailwindcss, React Scroll, React-Tooltip). 
While this may not be a very complex website, it is fully responsive to mobile, tablet, 
and desktop viewing. 

On this site you will find a main homepage that holds information about who I am, 
what I know, and some of the early projects that I've worked on. 
You will also find my contact info here. Each project I've listed also has its own page 
with more details about the venture.

I've done a complete revamp from the first version--a total overhaul of the design, a 
refactor of functions, and added a data.json in order to add dynamism.

Please enjoy and reach out if you encounter any issues or would like to chat!
