Welcome to my porfolio! I created this website using React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While this may not be a very complex website, it is fully responsive to mobile and desktop viewing. 

On this site you will find an intro page that gives a bit of info about myself and my stack, an about page that gives more of my backstory, a project page that gives details and links to websites I've built, and a contact page with links to my LinkedIn, Github, and Resume. While my cell phone number is not displayed on the site itself, it can be found on my resume or here: 720-774-0205.

Please enjoy and reach out if you encounter any issues or would like to chat!
