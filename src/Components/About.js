                <p className='para'>After growing up and living in small-town Indiana for the first 18 years of my life, I took my first step in finding who I truly was by attending Purdue University.
                    The four years I spent there studying also gave me the opportunity to truly discover who I was: someone who wanted more. By the end of my studies, I determined
                    that I needed to get away, and I found myself in Colorado.

                    I've lived in Colorado for three and a half years now. At the end of three years working for a tax debt resolution firm, I decided that I needed to do something more
                    challenging than the work I was currently doing. I dabbled in computer programming in high school but had not pursued it further after graduation. 
                    Quarantine gave me the opportunity to do soâ€”I found myself taking a free online class for coding in my spare time.

                    A little taste was all it took for me to fall in love with coding. I felt like I'd finally discovered what I was meant to do. So, I took the plunge and enrolled in
                    DevMountain's Web Development program. After 13 simultaneously long and short weeks, I've graduated and am ready to show the world who the real Brooke Miller is.
