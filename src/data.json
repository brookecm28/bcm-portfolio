        "After moving to Colorado and working in a tax debt resolution firm for three years, I decided that I needed more. I had a job, but I wanted a career. Computer programming immediately came to mind.",
        "When the world went into quarantine and commuting was removed from my schedule, I took advantage of the time I gained by taking an online coding class. A little taste was all it took for me to fall in love. I enrolled in DevMountain’s Web Development program, where I built foundations in coding logic, multiple languages, and full-stack web development.",
        "That education prepared me for my first job as a software engineer, where I began my career in the industry that is right for me. My current position has allowed me to continue growing as a web developer by providing me with challenges to tackle and dedicated time to add to my stack. Now, with real-world experience under my belt, I’m ready to take the next step in my career."
